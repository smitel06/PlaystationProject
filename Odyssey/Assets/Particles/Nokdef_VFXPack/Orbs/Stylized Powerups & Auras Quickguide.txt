QUICK START
-----------
The default rendering version on this package is the URP. If you want to upgrade for either HDRP or Standard rendering pipeline, you may do so by importing the provided unity packages inside the folder "Assets\Nokdef_VFXPack\Orbs"

Once you have the right rendering pipeline selected, you can simply choose a particle system inside of the "Assets\Nokdef_VFXPack\Orbs" folder and drag it into the scene.
